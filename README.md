Hi, I’m Zachary Djerdjouri a second year Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of Ottawa.
In the past, I have worked for the National Institute of Scientific Research where I developed programs for data aqcuisition, image processing, and
for data analysis using Python and its many modules (Pandas, Numpy, MatplotLib, Plotly, Dash, OpenCV, sklearn, etc).
I’m interested backend development and data science.
